JS Native Webcam Interface (WIP)

## What?
Yes, I see, you're pretty confused.
This project is meant to expose an easy to use interface to interact with your webcam in weird ways.
The idea is to implement a simple platform that could be extended to be used as a Vue/React Component for example...

## But why?
Well, `amw/jpeg_camera` is dead, `jhuckaby/webcamjs` recomends the former for being "actively manteined"...

We need this, trust me.

## No we don't
Yes we do, and you might! so add this to your watch list so you can keep an eye on further updates!
